    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given <a href="http://phpjs.org/blog/2013/05/03/a-word-on-the-focus-of-php-dot-js/">the focus of php.js</a> I think
we should re-invent as few wheels as possible and make use of sensible tools
and standards that are other people have already invested a great deal of time
in to get right.</p>

<p>In this light, I&#8217;ve decided to adopt <a href="http://nodeguide.com/style.html">Felix&#8217; Node.js Style Guide</a>
for coding standards, instead of running our own.</p>

<p>It saves us time maintaining and it becomes easier for people to contribute because
they don&#8217;t have to memorize where php.js diverges.</p>

<p>For the big parts our codebase is already compatible with it, so
we won&#8217;t get any weird <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/TabsSpacesBoth.png">space + tab</a> indentations as a result, as we start adding code that follows the guide.</p>

<p>Going forward, contributions should comply with these conventions before being
merged in.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everybody,</p>

<p>The <a href="http://phpjs.org/blog/2012/09/26/new-site/">new site</a> has no server-side code. Instead
we generate HTML <a href="http://kvz.io/blog/2012/09/25/blog-with-octopress/">using Octopress</a>
and push to GitHub Pages, all from one <a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs">repository</a>.</p>

<p>This saves hosting costs/overhead and makes it really easy for people to submit
pull requests and for <a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/contributors">contributors</a>
to make changes that I don&#8217;t always have time
for. It makes the project less dependent on me and more a community effort.</p>

<p>To move forward, sometimes you have to cut features.
In this case I had to lose our compiler, a webtool that relied on server-side code
to generate minified packages from php.js functions.</p>

<p>Understandibly this has <a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/issues/75">raised</a>
<a href="http://phpjs.org/about/index.html#comment-861825612">questions</a>.
It is still possible to bundle 4 useful functions:</p>

<p>but some people think php.js should bundle all of it&#8217;s functions into one big file:</p>

<blockquote><p>Not providing an all-in-one, downloadable, minified, ready-to-use
.js file is going to kill php.js.
You&#8217;ve abandoned windows users, and really any non-CLI junkie.
While I am capable of compiling this myself, what a headache.
You&#8217;ve introduced a barrier-to-entry that didn&#8217;t exist before,
and by not existing, allowed for the following you now have.
I <em>highly</em> suggest that you have this available for download,
either here or on github, such that you can keep (and maintain)
the momentum you worked so hard for.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d like to comment on that here. While I appreciate the sentiment, wether the
project is being killed by these changes depends on how you look at php.js.
To me, php.js is a resource:</p>

<ul>
<li>For PHP developers that want see how it&#8217;s done in JavaScript</li>
<li>That enables fun experiments</li>
<li>With a few higher level functions that are incredibly useful, and missing in JavaScript</li>
</ul>


<p>This is what I feel php.js should focus on. Making functions. Making them better.</p>

<p>If - on the other hand - you think of php.js as a</p>

<ul>
<li>2.1MB, 451-function, ready-to-rock spaceship that you can plug into your website so you can keep typing PHP client-side, not caring about learning JavaScript or how that extra weight might impact the user experience</li>
</ul>


<p>..then yes, <em>these changes are going to kill php.js</em>.</p>

<p>I have limited time to spend on open source, and I want to spend it on things I enjoy and can believe in.
Not on working to support use-cases that keep new developers from learning, or make the web slower.
I&#8217;m sorry if this upsets folks but it really is my free time.</p>

<p>Luckily though for people with different views, I released php.js under MIT so
it&#8217;s cool for anybody to fork this project and run with it.</p>

<p>If anything, knowing that the php.js repository will focus on the raw <code>./functions</code>
makes this easier.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

    <updated>2012-09-26T17:39:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://phpjs.org/blog/2012/09/26/new-site</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everybody,</p>

<p>Welcome to our new site.
The old one had a lot of dead weight that nobody used and was basically unmaintained.</p>

<p>This one is generated by Octopress as plain html, and then stored on Github pages.</p>

<p>The source to do that is inside the php.js directory in the <code>_octopress</code> dir,
and freely available.</p>

<p>For instance, you can now very easily:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/edit/master/_octopress/source/about/index.markdown">edit the about page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/edit/master/_octopress/source/_posts/2012-09-26-new-site.markdown">change this blog post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/blob/master/_octopress/source/_includes/custom/navigation.html">checkout the navigation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/blob/master/_octopress/Rakefile#L30">improve the way function pages are built</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Next, any <a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/graphs/contributors">php.js contributor</a>
who has <a href="http://kvz.io/blog/2012/09/25/blog-with-octopress/">Octopress set up</a>
(this mostly involves having the right ruby &amp; gem versions) can then run
<code>make site MSG="describe what you did"</code> in the
project&#8217;s root dir to deploy the changes.</p>

<p>This should make it easy for <a href="https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/graphs/contributors">php.js contributors</a>
(or any Github user really, using pull requests)
to update the site, making it less dependent on few core members, and more a
community effort.</p>

<p>This is also the way I want to do regular php.js development. Less via comments,
more via the power of Github.</p>

<p>To people wondering where the compiler has gone to, I&#8217;m discontinuing that feature.
It was more often broken then working, and I think this site should focus on
being a simple resource and discussion platform, and not much else.</p>

<p>Now that everything is open sourced more I think there&#8217;s room for anyone to build
a better alternative.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m not actively involved with php.js anymore, I hope taking this step will
make the project ready for the future.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>
